# multivariate-statistics-iris
"""
This is for people who understand the basics of R programming, and have a strong understanding of statistics. Statistical concepts are assumed to be previously understood, so the focus is just on the efficiency and power of R for analysis.

This data set is from the built-in dataset 'iris' within R. It is widely available on the Internet, from Fischer's initial collection. The packages required are; MASS, magrittr, dplyr and GGally and the XL package if you are loading iris from your local device. The CSV file has been uploaded in this repository.
